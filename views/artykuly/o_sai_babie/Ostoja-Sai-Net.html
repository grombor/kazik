                      Dear Sai-Netters,</div>
                    <div style="text-indent: 1.25cm">
                      These days I have read a brand new Sai-book which 
                    made such a great impression on me that I felt urge 
                    to share something about it with all of you. Since it
                    is in Polish it will take some time until hopefully
                    all the world will be able to enjoy it fully. 
                    The book is entitled <i>"<b>First Steps towards Love. 
                    Conversations with a Spiritual Master</b>"</i> and is written by
                    <b>Daniel Ostoja</b> (pronounced as Ostoya).</div>
                    <div style="text-indent: 1.25cm">
                      The book very much resembles the famous <i>"Conversations
                    with God"</i> by Neale D. Walsch, however the God here is our
                    Swami Himself and the author is His devotee who after 
                    intense <i>sadhana</i> obtained Grace of becoming a scribe of
                    His word. Although there is no mention about an outer,
                    physical blessing of the book by Swami, its content
                    carries such a power that to me there seem no need for 
                    any wordly confirmation.</div>
                    <div style="text-indent: 1.25cm">
                      Mentioning Neale's books, it will be of interest to all
                    to note an indirect evidence that they are also 
                    a 'product' of Swami (the understanding, that everything 
                    is His making, aside), for Daniel in his conversations says
                    something like 'In Neale's books You state so and so' and
                    the Master accepts it matter-of-factly.</div>

                    <div style="text-indent: 1.25cm">
                      The main theme of the book is Love. <i>"This book will be 
                    devoted to Love written by capital 'M', or Divine Love, 
                    its working in the world and path of man to it.
                    This path consists of many stages and we shall discuss 
                    them all in turn. Presently on Earth there are people of
                    all stages of evolution/development – from weakly formed
                    intellects to highly evolved spiritual Masters. The 
                    latter have come down onto earth because of the end of 
                    certain age and transition to another – the age of Truth,
                    in which God will be recognized as the Perpetrating Cause 
                    of the Universe. [...]
                    In this book I shall tell how one can get to live with 
                    God in close and full of joy friendship, how to find 
                    in Him a trustee, companion and loving, devoted friend."</i>
                    [page 46]</div>
                    <div style="text-indent: 1.25cm">
                     Many easy and appealing methods are given for people 
                    who want to develop this Love and get indeed very close 
                    to God. Here is one example of such a practice proposed: 
                    <i>"Concentrate on God considering Him as someone whom 
                    you love dearly. Imagine that you approach Him and 
                    embrace Him affectionately. This is the best way."</i> [127]</div>
                    <div style="text-indent: 1.25cm">
                      Besides this dominating theme of Love a range of subjects 
                    are considered at least on passing. A few examples that 
                    caught my attention:</div>
                    <div style="text-indent: 1.25cm">
                      — Death and dying (crossing the tunnel, prayers for

                    is beginning of life"</i> [193]).</div>

                    the decision always belongs to God, i.e. should be seeked 
                    in Him. [135])</div>

                    I shall touch everybody. Here. Now.</i> [222]</div>

                    president? Tell me and I shall stake a large sum of 
                    money on him and win.</i><br>
                    A: <i>The same man as is now, but if you'll stake too 
                    much, you will lose. Do not run the risk.</i> [143]
                    [No more details are given. I assume the president in 
                    question is that of USA, not Poland, for our president 
                    already serves this position second and the last 
                    tenure. Also, I assume this part of conversation took 
                    place last year. Generally, however, no dates are 
                    specified in the book.]</div>

                    And here is a freshly written and only slightly edited posting 
                    (of Nov 7th, 2005) to the same Sai-Net forum

                                    About a year ago I have posted here a review of a most amasing 
                                   book that appeared in Poland and apparently dictated by Sai 
                                   through an inner voice to His devotee by pen-name of Daniel 
                                   Ostoja. Then, I have expressed my sincere enthusiasm for 
                                   the book content and shared with you a few excerpts translated 
                                   from Polish (for those who have not read it I placed an edited 
                                   version at 
                                        <a href="#top">http://sai.5v.pl/SSB/Inne/Ostoja-Sai-Net.htm</a>
                                   with a scan of the book cover).
                                     Last month I have received ... guess what! Yes, a second book
                                   by the same author and all throughout written in the same vein 
                                   and about the same matter: Love (meaning Love of God or just 
                                   God). Also, it carries the same subtitle ('<i>Converasations with 
                                   a Spiritual Master</i>'), but is differently entitled: '<i>Boundless 
                                   Love</i>'.

                                    It is difficult to express the feelings of something great
                                   happening that I felt while reading this second volume. It 
                                   must therefore be true that He has, as He Himself mentioned 
                                   in the book, blessed it with extra energy so that reading it 
                                   alone much influences the reader.
                                    That first book, '<i>The First Steps towards Love</i>', the Master 
                                   has now described as the most important book that was written 
                                   in this country (Poland) during the entire 20th century.
                                    The third book of this series has been announced to appear.
                                   So in this respect it will resemble still more the triple book 
                                   of '<i>Conversations with God</i>' by N.D. Walsch, of which the Master
                                   said it teaches knowledge or theory while the present writing
                                   is devoted to Love. To me it sounded like ascribing the Neale's 
                                   series to well known to us notion of <i>jnana-marga</i> (path of 
                                   knowledge) and the Daniel's one to <i>bhakti-marga</i> (path of 
                                   devotion).
                                    Here is an important excerpt that I decided to translate 
                                   sentence by sentence trying to be as precise as I can, for if 
                                   it is really that great as stated in the last paragraph cited
                                   below, it would be pity to keep you awaiting for a full book
                                   translation.
                                   
                                    "<i>If you want to meditate, sit down in solitude and ask 
                                   the Highest for help in this journey. Breath evenly for some 
                                   time, and then imagine the Universe as a huge ball in which 
                                   your planet is only a tiny dot.
                                     Then, raise eyes still higher - look beyond the Universe 
                                   and see gigantic Sun effulgent with unheard-of brillance. 
                                   Envision that a blazing ray emanates from Him and touches 
                                   the top of your head. Pure and luminous brightness pervades 
                                   the entire head and, as if focused by a large lens, converges 
                                   in your heart. After a longer while let the Light flow from 
                                   the heart out to all nooks of your body, mind and soul. Let 
                                   this part of the practise continue for about ten to twenty 
                                   minutes. It may be accompanied by various phenomena, but 
                                   remain unconcerned regarding them as small gifts from someone 
                                   who loves you very, very much. This meditation is good prior 
                                   to retiring.
                                     Meditate keeping in front of yourself imagined golden ball 
                                   of the Universe and behind it luminous Form of the Creator – 
                                   the pure, untainted Light unceasingly emitting Its rays in 
                                   all directions. Become One with Him.
                                     Thanks to this meditation numerous Beings in the Great Cosmos 
                                   attained liberation. I pass it down to you </i>[plural 'you']<i> 
                                   on this planet for the first time. It is special boon of My 
                                   Love for all those who sincerely seek Love and wish to tread 
                                   Its paths.</i>" [Page 208/209]
                                   
                                     There are quite a few examples of Daniel's dreams interpreted
                                   by the Master. One of them seems to carry an unhappy prediction
                                   for all of us. Daniel had a vision. When near to falling asleep 
                                   he saw Osama bin Laden and soon afterwards a nuclear mushroom 
                                   appeared. This time the Master refused to talk about it saying 
                                   that it is too early for him to understand many events happening
                                   in the world. Daniel did not give up and later the conversation 
                                   went in part like this:
                                   Q: <i>There will be an explosion in a town.</i>
                                   A: <i>Maybe.</i>
                                   Q: <i>Hundreds of thousands of peaple will die.</i>
                                   A: <i>Maybe 'yes', maybe 'no'.</i>
                                   Q: <i>Cannot it be averted?</i>
                                   A: <i>Yes, it can.</i>
                                     [148,...]
                                   Q: <i>So, as I understand the doom of this town is sealed?</i>
                                   A: <i>No.</i>
                                   Q: <i>No?</i>
                                   A: <i>Until anything has happened, a matter is not closed.</i>
                                     [149,... (after some coversation, on p. 150:)]
                                   Q: <i>Master, I would like to get back for a while to the subject 
                                     matter I started this talk with. To the nuclear explosion.</i>
                                   A: <i>You listen carefully. An event can be averted through removal 
                                     of its causes; change of outcome can result from change of
                                     causes. You change causes, and outcomes will adjust themselves.
                                     The fact that your civilization does not respect the universal
                                     law, does not make the law work differently.</i>
                                   
                                    And so on went the conversation. In the end the reader is left
                                   with an impression that although there are chances for the event 
                                   to be averted, most probably it will happen. There is certain
                                   consolation for such tragic occurrences: the souls involved have 
                                   earlier decided to take over the karma of others and so sacrifice
                                   (die) for them ("<i>They</i> [the thousands of such souls] <i>have already 
                                   come down, they are already here</i>" [152]). In the previous book
                                   we have seen a somewhat vague prediction for the US presidential
                                   elections, which proved true. Now we have another prophecy, much
                                   more important but similarly vague. A thought crossed my mind: 
                                   one of reasons to place such things there could be that should 
                                   they come true, these books would draw attention of people that
                                   otherwise would be too suspicious of their genuineness.
                                    Dear Sai Family, there are so many things in the book I would 
                                   love to be able to tell you here and now, about the author 
                                   (besides, he is mathematician with a doctor degree), Golden Age 
                                   and various other subjects discussed on passing, for practically 
                                   every page brings some wisdom that sounds fresh and new. 
                                   Obviously, it cannot be done, so let us pray these books are 
                                   translated into English as promptly as can be done.
                                    I myself will eagerly await for the promised third volume of 
                                   this series and, if only given a chance, shall present to this 
                                   forum an overview. Let me conclude this review with an optimistic
                                   excerpt given at the very end of the book:
                                   
                                     <i>Now I am speaking to you, the reader. Whether you want it or 
                                   you do not, soon My Love will appear in your life and will let 
                                   you recognize Itself. How? You will see, within a short period 
                                   you will get convinced. And then a most interesting, most 
                                   wonderful and most unusual advanture in your life will begin. 
                                   Only wait on a little. And do smile.
                                     Today's time I compare to Christmas morning, when under 
                                   the Christmas tree there are numerous gifts. They are already 
                                   there waiting for you. In a moment they will be opened and there 
                                   will be no end to joy and love. Do Me a favour </i>[literally: make 
                                   Me feel a pleasure]<i> and smile [to Me]. I love so much your smile.
                                   It is time to finish this Tome and open an Other. In this Other 
                                   the Creator Himself, your Father, writes down words of love with 
                                   His heavenly pen on sheets of pure gold. This Tome is named 
                                   Universe. Come nearer to Him and hug Him tightly. He will teach 
                                   you how to read It. And there will be no end to the love that 
                                   will arise. Because It has no limits.</i> [p. 256]

                    Dear All, </font></p><div><font>
                    A few weeks ago I have laid hands on a new, the third volume of the
                    series of books on Love written by Daniel Ostoja under common title
                    of “<i>Conversations with a spiritual Master</i>”. The
                    Master talking to Daniel through the inner voice, it seems, is none
                    else than Bhagavan Shri Sathya Sai Baba, although, to my knowledge,
                    so far it was not outwardly confirmed by Him. I reviewed the previous
                    two volumes here on this forum in Autumns of 2004 and 2005. Those
                    reviews can be found at 
                    <font><a href="http://sai.5v.pl/SSB/Inne/Ostoja-Sai-Net.htm">
                    <font><font "#0000ff">this address</font></font></a></font></font>.</div>
                    <div><font>To remind,
                    these books are similar in quite a few respects to “<i>Conversations
                    with God</i>” by Neale D. Walsch and are supposed to influence
                    many, many people all over the world. They teach sort of <i>bhakti</i>
                    path, a tight closeness to Loving Creator in everyday life.</font></div>
                    <div style="text-indent: 1.cm; margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm"><font>	The third
                    volume is entitled “<i>Love in Action</i>”. It again
                    brings tremendous dose of invitations to Love. The master says at the
                    outset: '<font "navy">Do not doubt that what you now keep in
                    hands is one of the most important books of your life. For many of

                    you it is the most important one. I am here to prove it to you'</font>.</font></div>
                    <div><font>After a few
                    introductory chapters there are ten consecutive chapters devoted to
                    various meditations that not only directly strengthen love bonds with
                    God but also serve to cleanse our minds and, after some practice, can
                    be used to help whole the humanity in transformation process while it
                    moves to the Golden Age. This help having to do with those black
                    clouds of bad thought forms accumulated over millennia in other
                    dimensions that must be neutralized (of which some years ago many of
                    you must have heard from Isaac Tigrett). One special meditation
                    allows an access to the Book of Life which contains an answer to
                    humanity’s thousands years worth question of meaning and true
                    value of life. The meditating reader may ask the loving Creator for
                    being shown five pages most important to his life.</font></div>
                    <div><font>	The book
                    (the reviewed one, not that heavenly Book) content is composed of
                    Daniel’s daily experiences and dreams commented by the Master
                    and supported by citations from Sai Baba’s teachings, as well
                    as teachings of a few mystics or masters of the past. More space is
                    devoted to teachings of Spanish mystic and poet St. John of the Cross
                    (in the book under original name of Juan de Yepes) and his work “<i>The
                    Ascent of Mount Carmel</i>”, about which the Master said: ‘<span style="background: transparent"><font "navy">This
                    work goes much beyond its time</font><font "#800000">.</font></span>’
                    It appears this saint was Daniel himself in one of his previous
                    incarnations and those four centuries ago taught the same closeness
                    to God as he does now under inner guidance of none else but the same
                    Master. We are told that being a spiritual teacher in a few
                    incarnations Daniel still carries some karmic relations with many
                    past disciples and his present writings are meant also as a form of
                    fulfilling his karmic obligations. For our US members of this <i>satsang</i>
                    I should not omit to note a briefly discussed experience of Love
                    Daniel have had when during an incarnation he lived in a US farm. </font>
                    </div>
                    <div><font>
                     Another interesting point to note is a conversation about Sathya Sai
                    Organization understood by Daniel as a movement connected with the
                    Master. In this conversation the Master mentions the presence among
                    members of the Organization of agents sent by governments and other
                    political and religious institutions. Nevertheless, the Organization
                    should be regarded as a positive movement remembering that 
                    ‘<font "navy">organization is but humans, while God is
                    God</font>’. For ultimately we should leave it behind, as we
                    should all other worldly attachments, such as possessions, kin, and
                    own self to come to Loving Divinity and remain with It.</font></div>
                    <div>	As in earlier volumes, we have here ample measure
                    of wonderful prophecies on how the life on Earth will look like after
                    all the imminent changes take place, in times of commonly experienced
                    great love and joy, when people shall be conscious of Divinity
                    outwardly as now they are conscious inwardly. Daniel, while
                    conversing, notes that on the way to these glorious times dangers
                    await us, ‘among them I see a few nuclear explosions’.
                    You remember of a similar prediction in previous book, when the
                    Master was reluctant to confirm it straightaway. This time He answers
                    directly in affirmative but adds also an encouragement (see more in
                    the excerpts given here at the end).</div>
                    <div><font>	To the
                    question on credibility of the message of all these conversations the
                    Master’s reply is: '<font "navy">You are to a degree
                    the coauthor of this book. [...] I pass over to you certain teachings
                    so that you pass it further on. People may but do not have to accept
                    them, there is no such obligation. […] You want to get
                    assurance that what I say here are 100 % My words. But this is
                    entirely unnecessary. […] All of you should note that neither
                    in this nor in other My books the teaching or the content are not
                    really the point. The goal is quite different. This book is not meant
                    to be endlessly analyzed word by word from various points of view. It
                    may and should become a propeller to love. The teachings are not
                    nearly as important as love is.'</font> Further on He says that
                    everything said may be checked by ourselves in practice, and that if
                    in doubt on the content we may ask our inner voice. Finally there is
                    one more strong affirmation: 'T<font "navy">his book is
                    very, very good. As one of a few in the world it serves direct and
                    conscious coming close to loving Creator and therefore it deserves
                    the highest praise.'</font> It is a doorway to Light, it is a roadmap
                    but also a relay of hidden Power, a most precious Gift for which
                    thousands of masters all over the Earth await, thousands of beings
                    which are helping us.</font></div>
                    <div><font>	The volume
                    ends with a statement on forthcoming fourth book in the series.</font></div>
                    <div><font>	I know of a
                    devotee who translates the books into German.</font></div>
                    <div lang="pl-PL"><font>

                    <div>	<font "#4700b8="" "="" "navy">Master: You consider
                    yourselves to be Germans, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Chinese and
                    Americans but I tell you point-blank: there is nothing like France,
                    Poland or Germany. America and Australia do not exist either. All
                    this Earth, all the continents down to the minutest grain of sand
                    belong to Divinity and it never was or will be otherwise. Therefore,
                    people who love Divinity naturally quit being a part of this world of
                    dream and stand in love in front of Beloved. [80]</font></div>
                    <div><font "navy"><font>Master:
                    You are still a young race and you do not understand your place in
                    the cosmic ecosystem. But time is nearing when you will be able to
                    grasp it, so you should get ready. Interesting times are awaiting you
                    in near future – you’ll see it yourselves. Guests from
                    other dimensions will be coming down here in an increasing frequency,
                    because your civilization is approaching the turning point –
                    opening of consciousness out onto miracles and mysteries of the
                    Universe, onto Life and Love that exist and manifest there. Open off
                    your hearts and your sensitivity to the gentle song of the Cosmos.
                    You are, and always were, its part. The Universe is full of life and
                    full of Love. Many of you soon will experience it themeselves.</font></font></div>
                    <div><font "navy"><font>	Previously
                    I have mentioned of visits from the Cosmos and today I want to
                    continue this subject. Contrary to what may appear, it is an
                    important issue. Cosmic beings are among you for thousands of years
                    now. Older civilizations have visited Earth even before humankind
                    came into being and considerably helped in your evolution. For this
                    you should be grateful to them.</font></font></div>
                    <div><font "navy"><font>	Humanity
                    is not the only form of life in the Universe. Hundreds of millions of
                    planets is teeming with life. The beings living on most of them
                    became aware of Me and My working a long time ago. Many civilizations
                    have learned to cooperate with Me and now such time is coming for
                    you. […]</font></font></div>
                    <div><font "navy"><font>	I
                    would like you to understand My offer right. I do not take anything
                    away from you. Just the opposite, I want to give you something very
                    valuable, something most precious in the world and Universe. It is
                    Love of God and opportunity to live each day in It and cooperating
                    with It – touchably, tangibly, experienceably and verifiably.
                    You will lose the stupidity of ego, aggression; thousands of diseases
                    and misfortunes will just disappear. Pain and suffering will slowly
                    go away into the past. Simply there is no alternative, since the
                    other possibility would be only to destroy you all as the inhabitants
                    of this Earth. [220]</font></font></div>
                    <div><font "navy"><font>	[In
                    your future] the Earth will look somewhat differently than it does
                    today. Many bustling cities and housing estates will disappear. They
                    will be replaced by dispersed houses, blended into ecosystems and
                    closely fit to them. Fit not only with respect to the physical sphere
                    but also spiritual one. […] The Cosmos will stand open for
                    you. You will explore further and further planets and planes. There
                    will come also a [remoter] time when you will reach the living
                    spiritual Center of this Creation, wherefrom emerge all the
                    Universes, hundreds before this one, and millions yet to come. You
                    will live at the contact of Light and world, at the place where they
                    meet, on the verge of Infinity. […] </font></font>

                    not know where and when, but I do see them and hear them. They are

                    Dear boy. Time to stop looking after the future. It is time to turn
                    towards the only value, and not images of the past or future. All
                    this is passing. Turn to what is eternal. If you were to find
                    yourself in an immediate vicinity of the danger, surely you cannot
                    escape. If not, there is no such a force that would be able to bring
                    you there. Do you understand what I want to tell?</font></font></div>

                    inner ‘television’ sometimes is not less dangerous than
                    the outer one. It directs your attention to the world (in Polish:
